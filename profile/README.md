# Playable Quotes

Welcome to the Playable Quotes organization! We specialize in creating innovative emulator software that allows authentic replays of software experiences. Our primary project, QuoteKit, empowers users to create and share "playable quotes" from their favorite games.

## QuoteKit

QuoteKit is a unique emulator tool that enables users to capture and share specific moments in games, encapsulated in self-contained quotes. These quotes allow players to replay and explore these moments in their own way.

### Features
- **Capture Moments**: Record specific game moments and save them as playable quotes.
- **Replay & Share**: Share quotes with others, allowing them to replay and interact with the recorded moments.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and SDK for developers to integrate and utilize QuoteKit.
